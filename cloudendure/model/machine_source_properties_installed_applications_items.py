A session cookie is returned upon successful execution of the \"login\" method. This value must then be provided within the request headers of all subsequent API requests.  ## Errors Some errors are not specifically written in every method since they may always return. Those are: 1) 401 (Unauthorized) - for unauthenticated requests. 2) 405 (Method Not Allowed) - for using a method that is not supported (POST instead of GET). 3) 403 (Forbidden) - request is authenticated, but the user is not allowed to access. 4) 422 (Unprocessable Entity) - for invalid input.  ## Formats All strings with date-time format are according to RFC3339.  All strings with \"duration\" format are according to ISO8601. For example, a full day duration can be specified with \"PNNNND\".   # noqa: E501

                                will be type checked and a TypeError will be
                                raised if the wrong type is input.
                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to
                                drill down to the model in received_data
                                when deserializing a response

                                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)
            _configuration (Configuration): the instance to use when

                                If passed, type conversion is attempted
                                If omitted no type conversion is done.
            _visited_composed_classes (tuple): This stores a tuple of
                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its

                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal
                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in
